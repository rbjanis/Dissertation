Psychotherapy feedback on the counseling center assessment of
psychological symptoms (CCAPS): Effects on outcome and client moderators
of effectiveness

PhD dissertation, Rebecca Janis. Defended on June 11, 2020.

While psychotherapy is largely effective, some clients do not improve
and even get worse during treatment. Psychotherapy routine outcome
monitoring and progress feedback have been shown to improve outcomes and
reduce rates of worsening during treatment. The present study evaluates
the effectiveness of a psychotherapy feedback system built for the
Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS), a
routine outcome monitoring instrument designed for use in college
counseling centers. Data collected before and after the implementation
of the CCAPS feedback system showed that outcomes, defined as reliable
worsening during treatment, pre to post treatment change, and rate of
symptom change, were not improved after the addition of the feedback
system. While the impact of feedback varied somewhat by counseling
center, this variance was small. Further, the impact of feedback did not
vary meaningfully by any client moderators tested. Implications and
directions for future psychotherapy feedback research, as well as
practice-oriented research, are discussed.
